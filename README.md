# ðŸ’« About Me:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on a [literate programming](http://literateprogramming.com/) tool for creating readable documentation for config files.

ðŸŒ± I'm hoping to grow the [djot](https://djot.net/) ecosystem.

ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m currently learning a lot about Rust & Scheme, and working on distributed services in .NET.
